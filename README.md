![AAVE](https://github.com/yutongquan/STATS201_Problem_Set_2_Explanation/blob/main/spotlight/figure%201.png)

*Figure No.1. Source: [SoK: Blockchain Decentralization](https://github.com/SciEcon/SoK_Blockchain_Decentralization/), created by [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/)*

Figure No.1 represents the dencity of AAVE token's 30-day moving average of the decentralization index. X-axis shows the dates from Oct, 2020 to Jan, 2023. Y-axis shows the 30-day moving average of decentralization index. The legend shows that the average has a higher density when the color is close to yellow and it has the lower density when the color is close to purple. We can learn from the figure that on Nov.14, 2021, when the SMA30 = 250, it has the highest density of 62.

![COMP](https://github.com/yutongquan/STATS201_Problem_Set_2_Explanation/blob/main/spotlight/figure%202.png)

*Figure No.2. Source: [SoK: Blockchain Decentralization](https://github.com/SciEcon/SoK_Blockchain_Decentralization/), created by [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/)*

Figure No.2 represents the dencity of the COMP token's 30-day moving average of the decentralization index. X-axis shows the dates from Jan, 2020 to Jan, 2023. Y-axis shows the 30-day moving average of decentralization index. The legend shows that the average has a higher density when the color is close to yellow and it has the lower density when the color is close to purple. We can learn from the figure that on Mar.30, 2022, when the SMA30 = 75, it has the highest density of 106.

![LUSD](https://github.com/yutongquan/STATS201_Problem_Set_2_Explanation/blob/main/spotlight/figure%203.png)

*Figure No.3. Source: [SoK: Blockchain Decentralization](https://github.com/SciEcon/SoK_Blockchain_Decentralization/), created by [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/)*

Figure No.3 represents the dencity of the LUSD token's 30-day moving average of the decentralization index. X-axis shows the dates from Jan, 2020 to Jan, 2023. Y-axis shows the 30-day moving average of decentralization index. The legend shows that the average has a higher density when the color is close to yellow and it has the lower density when the color is close to purple. We can learn from the figure that on Aug.16, 2021, when the SMA30 = 50, it has the highest density of 76.
